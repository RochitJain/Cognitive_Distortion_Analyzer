1. All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White)

    1. Formal definition
    Interpreting outcomes or attributes as exclusively one of two extremes, with no intermediate or partial states.

    2. Inclusion criteria (MUST be present)
        •	Binary framing (success/failure, good/bad, perfect/useless)
        •	Absence of gradation, probability, or partial success

    3. Exclusion criteria (DO NOT label if)
        •	Clear thresholds are defined (e.g., pass/fail exams with fixed rules)
        •	Comparative but graded language is used (“better,” “worse,” “improving”)

    4. Clear example
        •	“If I don’t do this perfectly, I have completely failed.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“This presentation wasn’t good.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	Overgeneralization: This distortion is about extremes, not repetition across events.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“Always,” “never,” “completely,” “totally,” “either/or,” “nothing”

⸻------------------

2. Overgeneralization

    1. Formal definition
    Drawing a general rule or conclusion based on a single event or limited evidence.

    2. Inclusion criteria
        •	One or few instances
        •	Broad conclusion applied across time, people, or situations

    3. Exclusion criteria
        •	Conclusions supported by multiple independent examples
        •	Statistical or probabilistic language (“often,” “sometimes”)

    4. Clear example
        •	“I failed this interview, so I will never get a job.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“This keeps happening to me.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	All-or-Nothing: Overgeneralization extends across instances, not extremes.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“Every time,” “everyone,” “everything,” “never again”

⸻-------------

3. Catastrophizing

    1. Formal definition
    Predicting an outcome as extremely negative or disastrous without proportional evidence.

    2. Inclusion criteria
        •	Escalation to worst-case consequence
        •	Disproportion between event and predicted outcome

    3. Exclusion criteria
        •	Realistic risk assessment with evidence
        •	Explicit probability or contingency planning

    4. Clear example
        •	“If I make a mistake in this email, my career is over.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“This could go really badly.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	Fortune Telling: Catastrophizing focuses on severity, not just prediction.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“Disaster,” “ruined,” “end of everything,” “worst possible”

4. Mind Reading

    1. Formal definition
    Assuming the thoughts, beliefs, or judgments of others without direct evidence.

    2. Inclusion criteria
        •	Claim about another person’s internal state
        •	No stated confirmation or observation

    3. Exclusion criteria
        •	Explicit quotes, messages, or observable statements
        •	Reasoned inference with stated evidence

    4. Clear example
        •	“They think I’m incompetent.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“They probably didn’t like my idea.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	Personalization: Mind reading is about what others think, not blame.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“They think,” “they must believe,” “everyone sees me as”

⸻---------

5. Fortune Telling

    1. Formal definition
    Predicting a future outcome as certain without sufficient evidence.

    2. Inclusion criteria
        •	Future-oriented statement
        •	Certainty or inevitability implied

    3. Exclusion criteria
        •	Probabilistic forecasts
        •	Predictions based on strong historical data

    4. Clear example
        •	“I will fail the exam.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“This probably won’t work.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	Catastrophizing: Fortune telling is about certainty, not extremity.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“Will happen,” “going to,” “no chance,” “inevitable”

⸻

6. Emotional Reasoning

    1. Formal definition
    Treating subjective feelings as evidence for objective truth.

    2. Inclusion criteria
        •	Feeling stated
        •	Conclusion directly derived from that feeling

    3. Exclusion criteria
        •	Feelings mentioned without factual conclusion
        •	Feelings supported by external evidence

    4. Clear example
        •	“I feel stupid, so I am stupid.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“I feel like I didn’t do well.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	Mind Reading: Emotional reasoning relies on internal emotion, not others.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“I feel like,” “because I feel,” “it feels true”

⸻

7. Personalization

    1. Formal definition
    Attributing external events to oneself without sufficient causal evidence.

    2. Inclusion criteria
        •	Self-blame
        •	Event not demonstrably caused by the speaker

    3. Exclusion criteria
        •	Direct responsibility is established
        •	Explicit admission of fault with evidence

    4. Clear example
        •	“The meeting was awkward because of me.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“I might have caused the issue.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	Mind Reading: Personalization is about causation, not judgment.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“My fault,” “because of me,” “I caused”

⸻

8. Should Statements

    1. Formal definition
    Using rigid rules or obligations as absolute standards for behavior or outcomes.

    2. Inclusion criteria

        •	Implied violation or judgment

    3. Exclusion criteria
        •	Preferences or goals stated without judgment
        •	External rules (laws, job requirements)

    4. Clear example
        •	“I should never make mistakes.”

    5. Borderline example
        •	“I should try harder next time.”

    6. Common confusion
        •	All-or-Nothing: Should statements impose rules, not extremes.

    7. Typical linguistic cues
        •	“Should,” “must,” “have to,” “ought to”
